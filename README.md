<h2>Introduction</h2>

```
Semelparity and iteroparity are two contrasting reproductive strategies available to living organisms.
A species is considered semelparous if it is characterized by a single reproductive episode before death,
and iteroparous if it is characterized by multiple reproductive cycles over the course of its lifetime.

> producing only once in a lifetime
